# Analysis & Data Presentation Laboratory- 094295
## HW2-face-mask-detection

Python code for face-mask object detection &amp; classification task using Torchvision fasterRCNN. 

The repository includes a project report under `Project_Report.pdf` file. 

In order to evaluate the trained model on a new dataset, run _python predict.py >PATH_TO_FOLDER>_. This will save a prediction.csv file with the predictions, in the same directory. 

The repository also includes: 
* `basic_experiment` dir with the basic model we have trained- for more information please look at the report. 
* loading dataset script- `dataset.py` 
* training script- `train.py `
* main script- `main.py` that runs the training process using functions from `my_utils` dir, and parameters from `cfg` dir. 
* EDA script- `EDA.py` 

In addition, the repository includes example images, example images script and example prediction script.
